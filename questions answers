1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- Developed and verified frameworks and selenium regression test scripts. Intense mutation test was a mandate for every cycle or any new test development which was accomplished.

2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
- I would thing its the transformation from traditional project development model to Continuous Integration and Continuous Development

3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
I haven't had the opportunity to work on legacy applications as primarily I did Web Automation. However if given an opportunity, depending on the nature of the legacy application (ex: Mainframe CICS), I would use more compatible tools like UFT or LFT

4.	 How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
I observe that the response times can be improved on the site, the website currently asks for location info from the user, but I feel it should pick it up from the IP by default and suggest local choices automatically, keeping the business proactive.
